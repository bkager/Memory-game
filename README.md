# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Ideas:
Button to reset board
Bomb mode: if you've turned a bomb card over once, the next time you flip it it explodes
Button to toggle different card image sets (Halloween, other themes, etc. )
Button to flip all cards, marking ones you didn't get
