Bugs:
-Rendering issue when changing themes

Ideas:
-Improve CSS

- add grid for cards
- improve fonts
  -Button to reset board
  -Bomb mode: if you've turned a bomb card over once, the next time you flip it it explodes
  -Button to flip all cards, marking ones you didn't get
  -Two-player mode
  -Online mode

  -Button to toggle different card image sets (Halloween, other themes, etc. )
